# Merge-Sort

In this exercise we're using Merge Sort to sort a very large array containing 1000,000 numbers. Merge Sort has a runtime complexity of O (n log n). Which 
is much faster than naive quadratic ( On2) sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort.   Merge Sort can be  more efficient than Quick Sort on very large arrays or data sets.
